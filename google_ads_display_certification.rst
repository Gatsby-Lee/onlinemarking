1. Display targeting
====================

Google Display ads is designed to help you find the right audience. Its targeting options allow you to strategically show your message to users at the right place and the right time.

Why Display targeting?
----------------------

You can use targeting to direct your campaign’s ads to the people you want to reach most.


2. Build awareness
==================

When you want to reach a broad audience and maximize your brand exposure, we recommend selecting build awareness as your Display campaign marketing objective. 

* ``Demographic targeting:`` Demographic targeting enables you to show ads to users based on a combination of declared and inferred data. You can target based on age, gender, and parental status. 
* ``Affinity audiences:`` With Affinity audiences, you can reach TV-like audiences based on a holistic picture of their lifestyles, interests, and passions. Choose from over 100 segments based on online behavior. Google’s best-in-class algorithm distinguishes these users that are truly passionate about a topic rather than those that are merely interested.
* ``Custom affinity audiences:`` If one of the 100+ off-the-shelf Affinity audiences doesn’t meet your needs, create your own with Custom Affinity audiences. This feature allows you to define and target custom-made audiences, giving you substantive reach against niche groups of users.


3. Influence consideration
==========================

When you want to engage with users that are actively researching products or services, we recommend selecting influence consideration as your Display campaign marketing objective.

In-Market audiences
-------------------

Reach potential customers while they're actively browsing, researching, or comparing the types of products you sell and are close to a conversion. Connect with those most interested in what you have to offer, using precise segments that classify users based on their demonstrated in-market behavior and purchase intent.

Standard remarketing

Show ads to your past visitors as they browse network websites and use network apps. Communicate with people who've previously visited key pages on your website across screens, giving you a powerful new way to match the right user with the right message.

Dynamic remarketing

Work to boost your results with dynamic remarketing, which takes remarketing to the next level with ads that include products or services that people viewed on your website. Create dynamically generated display ads with product data pulled from a pre-uploaded feed. You can achieve great performance showing to users products they have seen on your website, with low effort in campaign, ads, and remarketing lists creation.
