Reach Users on Google Display Ads
#################################

three marketing objectives that can be met via targeting on Google Display ads
===============================================================================

1. Build awareness
2. influence consideration
3. drive action

Which targeting option is best for achieving brand awareness??
==============================================================

Affinity


1. Display targeting
====================

Google Display ads is designed to help you find the right audience. Its targeting options allow you to strategically show your message to users at the right place and the right time.

Why Display targeting?
----------------------

You can use targeting to direct your campaign’s ads to the people you want to reach most.


2. Build awareness
==================

When you want to reach a broad audience and maximize your brand exposure, we recommend selecting build awareness as your Display campaign marketing objective. 

* ``Demographic targeting:`` Demographic targeting enables you to show ads to users based on a combination of declared and inferred data. You can target based on age, gender, and parental status. 
* ``Affinity audiences:`` With Affinity audiences, you can reach TV-like audiences based on a holistic picture of their lifestyles, interests, and passions. Choose from over 100 segments based on online behavior. Google’s best-in-class algorithm distinguishes these users that are truly passionate about a topic rather than those that are merely interested.
* ``Custom affinity audiences:`` If one of the 100+ off-the-shelf Affinity audiences doesn’t meet your needs, create your own with Custom Affinity audiences. This feature allows you to define and target custom-made audiences, giving you substantive reach against niche groups of users.


3. Influence consideration
==========================

When you want to engage with users that are actively researching products or services, we recommend selecting influence consideration as your Display campaign marketing objective.

In-Market audiences
-------------------

Reach potential customers while they're actively browsing, researching, or comparing the types of products you sell and are close to a conversion. Connect with those most interested in what you have to offer, using precise segments that classify users based on their demonstrated in-market behavior and purchase intent.

use the In-Market audience segment for outdoor recreational equipment.

Custom Intent audiences
-----------------------

If you want to create a tailored audience that isn't covered in one of our In-Market audience segments, Custom Intent is for you! Define and reach people that have the intent to purchase, updated in real-time. Simply enter keywords or URLs that best represent your audience or choose from one of our auto-created audiences.

create custom audience segments using keywords, URLs, and apps as inputs

Similar Audiences
-----------------

Similar Audiences finds users that are similar to an original remarketing list or other uploaded compatible list. It finds users that are similar in profile based on their recent browsing and interests around different topics.

use a “Similar to Cart Abandoners” remarketing list that's automatically created from her “Cart Abandoners” remarketing list

4. Drive action
---------------

When you want to re-engage with users that have already shown interest in your brand, we recommend selecting drive action as your Display campaign marketing objective.

Remarketing
------------

Remarketing lets you show ads to the people who demonstrated their interest in what you offer with their visit to your website or app. It’s how you reconnect with great prospects as they browse the millions of websites and apps available on the network.

Standard remarketing
--------------------

Show ads to your past visitors as they browse network websites and use network apps. Communicate with people who've previously visited key pages on your website across screens, giving you a powerful new way to match the right user with the right message.

``visited her website but not purchased``

Dynamic remarketing
-------------------

Work to boost your results with dynamic remarketing, which takes remarketing to the next level with ads that include products or services that people viewed on your website. Create dynamically generated display ads with product data pulled from a pre-uploaded feed. You can achieve great performance showing to users products they have seen on your website, with low effort in campaign, ads, and remarketing lists creation.

``viewed one of her bicycles but didn't purchase and show them an ad with that exact bicycle``

Deliver the Right Message on Google Display Ads
###############################################

two main ad formats can be used in a Google Display ads campaign?
=================================================================

* Responsive Display Ads
* Uploaded Ads


1. Display ad formats
=====================

Creatives are the face of your brand through advertising, so you want to make sure they represent you well. Ad formats let you choose how to communicate your business to your audience. 

2. Responsive Display Ads
=========================

Responsive Display Ads are Google’s marquee Display ad format and are the default ad type when creating a Display campaign. They represent the future of asset-based digital advertising.

What are Responsive Display Ads?
--------------------------------

Responsive Display Ads give you the ability to upload your own assets and create ads that serve in all ad slot sizes, into both native and non-native inventory. Simply upload your assets (images, videos, headlines, logos, and descriptions), and Google will automatically create ads. They're built for performance, reach, and scale.

Key benefits
------------

50% more conversions at a similar cost-per-acquisition (CPA) when advertisers add Responsive Display Ads to their image ad campaigns.

* ``Automation:`` machine learning model to determine the optimal combination of assets for each ad slot based on predictions built from your performance history
* ``Reach:`` Google assembles automatically adjust uploaded assets size, appearance, and format to fit just about any native or non-native ad slot
* ``Creative testing:`` Google does billions of creative A/B tests for your business. Google also leverages multiple machine learning modules (asset selection, color extraction, auto-fitting, and more) to create the right message to the right user across desktop, mobile, and apps.

3. Uploaded ads
===============

Uploaded ads offer greater control over the way your ads look and feel. You build your own ads outside of Google Ads and simply upload them to your Display campaign.

What are image ads?
-------------------

Created outside of Google Ads (in Google Web Designer, for example), image ads are uploadable as a .zip file into Google Ads. Image ads only run in banner-eligible slots, which has limited scale relative to Responsive Display Ads.

* ``Key Benefits:`` Complete creative control. You can develop these ads yourself using templates to decide how best to combine your different images, text, and logos.

What are AMPHTML ads?
---------------------

AMPHTML ads enable marketers, publishers, and technology providers to deliver faster, and more secure ad experiences across all platforms by applying the principles of AMP to building and serving ads. 

``Faster ads drive better performance:`` AMPHTML ads are 6x faster than regular ads on AMP pages, making them more viewable, more effective, and more likely to perform well.
``Lighter ads can lead to better ad experiences:`` AMPHTML ads are 3x lighter in load and rendering than regular ads which may result in users having a more positive experience with your brand. 
``Safer ads build trust in your brand:`` AMPHTML ads need validation before they’re served, reducing the risk of malware and building trust in the brands users are engaging with.

Increase Conversions with Performance Planner
#############################################

1. Why you should plan for performance with Performance Planner
===============================================================

Planning is the crucial first step to achieving success with Google Ads
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

By planning your Google Ads budgets on a monthly basis in advance, you can help ensure that when people need products or information, your ads can meet them at the right time to help maximize conversions and achieve your key performance indicators (KPIs).

By planning your Google Ads budgets in advance, you can:

1. Understand the future spend potential of current Google Ads campaigns to help drive budget decisions
2. Take advantage of seasonality to capture incremental opportunities 
3. Set optimal bids and budgets across your campaigns to help ensure that ROI performance is maximized
4. Find new opportunities to grow your sales volumes with Google Ads

How does Performance Planner forecast campaign performance?
-----------------------------------------------------------

* forecasting
* Simulation
* Machine learning
* validation

Why use Performance Planner in Google Ads over traditional forecasting methods?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Get accurate forecasts
* Get the benefits of machine learning


2. How to use Performance Planner
=================================

Why should I use Performance Planner every month?
-------------------------------------------------

Seasonality, fluctuating auctions, and competitors mean that Google Ads campaigns should be planned and optimized on at least a monthly basis.

* Create separate plans for each marketing objective

  Don't add all brand and generic campaigns into the same plan. That's because different campaigns often have different marketing objectives. Incremental conversions are achieved by creating separate plans for each marketing objective.

3. Take action with Performance Planner
=======================================

``NOTE!!`` Performance Planner is a planning tool and does not optimize in the Google Ads front end toward forecasted KPIs. Unpredictable external factors in a dynamic auction environment can mean Performance Planner forecasts may have discrepancies, so it's important to continually monitor performance and optimize toward performance targets.

Performance Planner Best Practices
----------------------------------

* Use non-last click attribution conversions
* Create multiple plans for campaigns that have differenet marketing objectives
* Use the performance targets feature
* Use optimization score in the Recommendations page to improve your campaigns

Here are some additional factors that you should check while budget planning:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Seasonality
* Market share
* growth

* Set bids and budgets using non-last click conversions

  By default, Performance Planner will forecast conversions based on what's included in the Conversions column in your Google Ads front end. To allocate budgets that drive incremental conversions, set bids and budgets using non-last click conversions in your Conversions column.

* Regularly check your plan

  Forecasts improve when plans are generated closer to the actual run date. Make sure to regularly check back on your plan before implementing it.
