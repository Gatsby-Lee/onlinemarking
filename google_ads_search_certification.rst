---------------------------------------

2. An auction starts
3. Google Search engine ranks all the ads ( based on Bid and Relevance )
4. Search turns into a sale


3. Manage which searches prompt your ads
=======================================

When you create a list of keywords in your ad group, you're telling Google’s algorithm which customer searches should match with your ads. 

How to control which searches prompt your ads
---------------------------------------------

1. ``Think like your customer:`` Match your keywords to what your customers may use when looking for your products or services. ( "Keyword Tarketing" )
2. ``Think about your business goals:`` ( visiting or purchasing )
3. Dynamic Search Ads

Five match type options for your keywords
-----------------------------------------

* Broad match (default match type) - ( the widest possible audience / doesn't miss out on any searches )
* Broad match modifier ( wide audience looking to buy a bike, while still narrowing )
* phrase match
* exact match
* negative

Broad match
-----------

* the widest possible audience / doesn't miss out on any searches
* ``How works?:`` showing ads if a keyword (or any variations like misspellings, synonyms, or related searches) are included in a user’s search terms.
* ``How help?:`` Ad with keyword "bike" can be shown to user searching "bicycle"

Broad match modifier
--------------------

* ``+`` sign in front of a keyword turns it into a broad match modifier
* e.g. +blue, +girl, +bike ( all three terms have to appear in Searched Keyword )

  * match: "blue bicycle for 6-year old girls"
  * not match: "girl bike"
  * match: "blue bicycles for sporty girls" - 'cuz bicycles is a close variant of bike

Broad match vs. Broad match modifiers
-------------------------------------

* ``Broad match:`` is a good fit if you want to spend less time building exhaustive keyword lists. Your keywords will match to a wider variation of search terms, and you'll reach people not necessarily searching for your specific brand or business. It’s like casting a wide net to reach searches related to your keywords.
* ``Broad match modifiers:`` allow you to indicate if there are certain concepts related to your keywords that must be present in the searches you reach

Phrase match
------------

* e.g. "brand bike"
* ``How works?:`` there cannot be any extra words between "brand" and "bike", but extra words can appear before or after the phrase match

Exact match
------------

* still include close variabtions of keywords ( misspellings, plurals, and synonyms )
* This is different from phrase match, as there can’t be any extra words before or after the search terms. 
* e.g.) [kids' bike sales]

  * match: kid bicycle sale
  * match: sale on kid bikes
  * match: children’s bike on sale
  * not match: kids’ bikes
  * not match: best kid kike sales ( why? - Exact match keywords only match to searches that mean the same thing as the keyword )

* e.g.) [running shoes]

  * match: shoes for running
  * not match: shoes best for running
  * match: running shoe
  * not match: best running shoes
  * match: running sneakers
  
Phrase match vs. Exact match
----------------------------
 
 * ``Phrase match:`` is a good fit if you’re looking for something that’s more flexible than exact match, but more targeted than broad match. It helps you reach more customers, while still showing your ads to those most likely searching for your product or service.
* ``Exact match:`` is a good fit if it's important to you to match with very specific user searches. Exact match keywords allow you to reach only searches that mean the same thing as your keywords.

negative keywords
-----------------

How to use match types so ads don't show up on the wrong searches?

* e.g.) preventing Ad with keyword "kids' kikes" to show up by "kids' scooters"
* -scooter

broader match types vs. exact match
-----------------------------------

The broader match types (broad and broad match modifier) help you discover terms that you might not be aware of already, whereas exact match is good for those search terms you know your customers will be using when they're searching for a product or service that you want to provide specific messaging for.

4. Complement your keyword strategy with Dynamic Search Ads ( DSA )
===================================================================

* The challenge of creating keyword lists ( + time-consuming )
*  Dynamic Search Ads uses Google’s understanding of your site to customize and target your ads.

How Dynamic Search Ads works
----------------------------

1. You specify the pages of your website, daily budget, and an ad template.
2. The customer enters their search term in Google Search
3. If you have content relevant to the search, Google dynamically generates an ad headline and destination URL to the best matching page on your site.

Targeting options for Dynamic Search Ads
----------------------------------------

* ``Landing pages from standard ad groups:`` This is the easiest option, as it includes all webpages that you’re already using as landing pages for your ads across your accounts.
* ``categories:`` Based on your website content, Google creates targetable categories, or sets of landing pages organized by theme. You decide which sets of pages to target, how to group similar pages, and the level of granularity.
* ``URL contains:`` You can target pages of your site containing specific strings ( based on the URL string )
* ``URL is:`` You can target specific URLs. 
* ``Page feeds:`` feed of specific URLs, mapped to custom labels that can be updated automatically. 

Key benefits of Dynamic Search Ads
----------------------------------

* Reach and coverage
* Efficiency and time savings
* Transparency and control

Position Dynamic Search Ads based on your business goals
---------------------------------------------------------

* ``Incremental reach:`` "I want to make sure my ads appear for more relevant user searches."
* ``Long-tail automation:`` “I want my users to find me even on my long-tail products."
* ``Rapid expansion:`` "I want to enter new markets quickly."

Understand the Google Ads Auction
#################################

1. What is the Google Ads auction?
==================================

How the Google Ads auction works
--------------------------------

* Google Ads uses an auction system to rank
* Google uses a special version of a second-price auction that takes into account more than just bids.
* second-price auction ( $0.01 more than the amount of the next highest bidder. )

  * e.g.) four bidder, $4, $3, $2, $1, the winner pays $3.01


How Ad Rank determines your ad position
---------------------------------------

* Bid
* Ad rank threshold ( ad quality )
* context of query ( search term, location, time, device )
* Ad extensions impact ( phone number, links to site )
* Action-time ad quality ( how relevant and useful your ad to the linked site )


The three main factors that determine the quality of an ad
----------------------------------------------------------

* expected clickthrough rate ( user feedback to drive decision making - CTRs )
* Ad landing page experience ( highly relevant landing page yields a higher score )

  * navigable
  * transparent about the nature of the business
  * intention to use their personal information

* Ad relevance ( on useful ads are shown / preventing unnecessary paying )


How Ad Rank influences actual cost per click
--------------------------------------------

* Oftentimes, average cost per click (CPC) is not the price you’re paying for each of your clicks
* Higher-quality ads typically lead to lower costs, better ad positions, and more advertising success.


2. Improving Ad Rank
====================

What is Quality Score?
----------------------

* Quality Score is an estimate of the quality of your ads, keywords, and landing pages.
* Quality score is composed of expected clickthrough rate, ad relevance, and landing page experience
* https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6167123


three main factors that determine ad quality
--------------------------------------------

* Expected clickthrough rate ( eCTR )
* Ad relevance
* Landing page experience

To improve your ad quality, focus on the three components of Quality Score
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ``Expected clickthrough rate:`` The likelihood that the add will be clicked

  * Expected clickthrough rate (eCTR) predicts whether your keyword is likely to lead to an ad click.
  * ``Be specific in your ad:`` Include keywords in your ad text (especially in the headline) to show people that your ad is directly relevant to their search.
  * ``Experiment with different calls to action:`` Do you offer free shipping or free returns? Call now vs. book now?
  * ``Highlight a unique benefit of your product or service:`` What makes you stand out from the competition? Think about what matters to users (perhaps an exceptional warranty or return policy).
  * ``Create time- or location-specific ad text:`` Test seasonal creative around holidays or special events, or test location-optimized creative.

* ``Ad relevance:`` How closely the ad matches the intent behind a user's search

  * ``Add negative keywords:`` Prevent your ads from showing on unwanted queries or queries not closely related to your product or service.
  * ``Be specific on mobile:`` If a user’s mobile search experience is different from desktop, test mobile-specific creatives.
  * ``Be local:`` Target the right region for your business by using only the relevant languages and locations.
  * ``Include relevant search terms in your ad copy:`` Adding search terms that are related to your business in your ad copy can help make your ad more resonant for users.

* ``Landing page experience:`` How relevant, transparent, add easy to navigate the page is for users

  * ``Send traffic to the right landing page:`` Direct clicks to pages related to a user’s query. If a search is for “striped shirts,” the landing page should feature striped shirts, not some other variety of shirts or clothing in general.
  * ``Be consistent:`` Make sure the landing page continues the conversation set up by your ad and follows through on the ad’s offer or call-to-action.
  * ``Make your site transparent and trustworthy:`` Make it easy for visitors to find your contact information, and clearly state what your business does. If you request personal information from customers, make it clear why you’re asking for it and what you’ll do with it.
  * ``Work on loading speed and clarity:`` Help users quickly find what they’re looking for by prioritizing the content that’s visible above-the-fold.
  * ``Rethink mobile:`` Ease of navigation is valued by users even more on mobile websites, so make sure yours is optimized.
