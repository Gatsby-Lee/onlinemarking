Explore the Value of Google Search
##################################

1. Recognize the value of Google Search Ads
============================================

``Translate user intent into business results``


2. Master the foundation of a Google Search campaign
====================================================

Setting up a Search campaign
----------------------------

* Where do you want your ads seen?
* How much do you want to invest?
* What do you want to share in your ads?
* What keywords will match your customer's search terms?

Create Search campaign
----------------------

* ``Goal:`` campaign ( marketing goal )
* ``Netowrk:`` Google Search Network ( Google Play / Shopping / Map ( + in Google Map ) / Partner
* ``Devices:`` Desktop / tablet / mobile
* ``Location and Languages:``
* ``bucket:``

Marketing goal examples
-----------------------

* ``Web traffic:`` get more customers to learn about your new products
* ``Leads:`` Gather contact details through a signup page
* ``Sales:`` Encourage customers to complete a purchase

Createing Campaigh
------------------

* ``Ad Group:`` text ads / keywords / themes ( granularity gives her more control to get the right ad message to the right customers )
* ``Keywords:`` For each ad group, she creates a unique list of keywords.
* ``Text Ads:`` Headline, URL, Description

  * ``Headline:`` To catch her customers' attention
  * ``URL:`` To reach a particular page on the Your Adventure site
  * ``Description:`` To highlight the details of what Your Adventure is offering

More Search Campaign Settings
-----------------------------

* Ad extensions ( store location / phone number )
* Start and end date for campaign ( e.g. for promotion )
* Ad scheduling

How do ads end up in front of customers
---------------------------------------

1. A person performs a search
2. An auction starts
3. Google Search engine ranks all the ads ( based on Bid and Relevance )
4. Search turns into a sale


3. Manage which searches prompt your ads
=======================================

When you create a list of keywords in your ad group, you're telling Google’s algorithm which customer searches should match with your ads. 

How to control which searches prompt your ads
---------------------------------------------

1. ``Think like your customer:`` Match your keywords to what your customers may use when looking for your products or services. ( "Keyword Tarketing" )
2. ``Think about your business goals:`` ( visiting or purchasing )
3. Dynamic Search Ads

Five match type options for your keywords
-----------------------------------------

* Broad match (default match type) - ( the widest possible audience / doesn't miss out on any searches )
* Broad match modifier ( wide audience looking to buy a bike, while still narrowing )
* phrase match
* exact match
* negative

Broad match
-----------

* the widest possible audience / doesn't miss out on any searches
* ``How works?:`` showing ads if a keyword (or any variations like misspellings, synonyms, or related searches) are included in a user’s search terms.
* ``How help?:`` Ad with keyword "bike" can be shown to user searching "bicycle"

Broad match modifier
--------------------

* ``+`` sign in front of a keyword turns it into a broad match modifier
* e.g. +blue, +girl, +bike ( all three terms have to appear in Searched Keyword )

  * match: "blue bicycle for 6-year old girls"
  * not match: "girl bike"
  * match: "blue bicycles for sporty girls" - 'cuz bicycles is a close variant of bike

Broad match vs. Broad match modifiers
-------------------------------------

* ``Broad match:`` is a good fit if you want to spend less time building exhaustive keyword lists. Your keywords will match to a wider variation of search terms, and you'll reach people not necessarily searching for your specific brand or business. It’s like casting a wide net to reach searches related to your keywords.
* ``Broad match modifiers:`` allow you to indicate if there are certain concepts related to your keywords that must be present in the searches you reach

Phrase match
------------

* e.g. "brand bike"
* ``How works?:`` there cannot be any extra words between "brand" and "bike", but extra words can appear before or after the phrase match

Exact match
------------

* still include close variabtions of keywords ( misspellings, plurals, and synonyms )
* This is different from phrase match, as there can’t be any extra words before or after the search terms. 
* e.g.) [kids' bike sales]

  * match: kid bicycle sale
  * match: sale on kid bikes
  * match: children’s bike on sale
  * not match: kids’ bikes
  * not match: best kid kike sales ( why? - Exact match keywords only match to searches that mean the same thing as the keyword )

* e.g.) [running shoes]

  * match: shoes for running
  * not match: shoes best for running
  * match: running shoe
  * not match: best running shoes
  * match: running sneakers
  
Phrase match vs. Exact match
----------------------------
 
 * ``Phrase match:`` is a good fit if you’re looking for something that’s more flexible than exact match, but more targeted than broad match. It helps you reach more customers, while still showing your ads to those most likely searching for your product or service.
* ``Exact match:`` is a good fit if it's important to you to match with very specific user searches. Exact match keywords allow you to reach only searches that mean the same thing as your keywords.

negative keywords
-----------------

How to use match types so ads don't show up on the wrong searches?

* e.g.) preventing Ad with keyword "kids' kikes" to show up by "kids' scooters"
* -scooter

broader match types vs. exact match
-----------------------------------

The broader match types (broad and broad match modifier) help you discover terms that you might not be aware of already, whereas exact match is good for those search terms you know your customers will be using when they're searching for a product or service that you want to provide specific messaging for.

4. Complement your keyword strategy with Dynamic Search Ads ( DSA )
===================================================================

* The challenge of creating keyword lists ( + time-consuming )
*  Dynamic Search Ads uses Google’s understanding of your site to customize and target your ads.

How Dynamic Search Ads works
----------------------------

1. You specify the pages of your website, daily budget, and an ad template.
2. The customer enters their search term in Google Search
3. If you have content relevant to the search, Google dynamically generates an ad headline and destination URL to the best matching page on your site.

Targeting options for Dynamic Search Ads
----------------------------------------

* ``Landing pages from standard ad groups:`` This is the easiest option, as it includes all webpages that you’re already using as landing pages for your ads across your accounts.
* ``categories:`` Based on your website content, Google creates targetable categories, or sets of landing pages organized by theme. You decide which sets of pages to target, how to group similar pages, and the level of granularity.
* ``URL contains:`` You can target pages of your site containing specific strings ( based on the URL string )
* ``URL is:`` You can target specific URLs. 
* ``Page feeds:`` feed of specific URLs, mapped to custom labels that can be updated automatically. 

Key benefits of Dynamic Search Ads
----------------------------------

* Reach and coverage
* Efficiency and time savings
* Transparency and control

Position Dynamic Search Ads based on your business goals
---------------------------------------------------------

* ``Incremental reach:`` "I want to make sure my ads appear for more relevant user searches."
* ``Long-tail automation:`` “I want my users to find me even on my long-tail products."
* ``Rapid expansion:`` "I want to enter new markets quickly."

Understand the Google Ads Auction
#################################

1. What is the Google Ads auction?
==================================

How the Google Ads auction works
--------------------------------

* Google Ads uses an auction system to rank
* Google uses a special version of a second-price auction that takes into account more than just bids.
* second-price auction ( $0.01 more than the amount of the next highest bidder. )

  * e.g.) four bidder, $4, $3, $2, $1, the winner pays $3.01


How Ad Rank determines your ad position
---------------------------------------

* Bid
* Ad rank threshold ( ad quality )
* context of query ( search term, location, time, device )
* Ad extensions impact ( phone number, links to site )
* Action-time ad quality ( how relevant and useful your ad to the linked site )


The three main factors that determine the quality of an ad
----------------------------------------------------------

* expected clickthrough rate ( user feedback to drive decision making - CTRs )
* Ad landing page experience ( highly relevant landing page yields a higher score )

  * navigable
  * transparent about the nature of the business
  * intention to use their personal information

* Ad relevance ( on useful ads are shown / preventing unnecessary paying )


How Ad Rank influences actual cost per click
--------------------------------------------

* Oftentimes, average cost per click (CPC) is not the price you’re paying for each of your clicks
* Higher-quality ads typically lead to lower costs, better ad positions, and more advertising success.


2. Improving Ad Rank
====================

What is Quality Score?
----------------------

* Quality Score is an estimate of the quality of your ads, keywords, and landing pages.
* Quality score is composed of expected clickthrough rate, ad relevance, and landing page experience
* https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6167123


three main factors that determine ad quality
--------------------------------------------

* Expected clickthrough rate ( eCTR )
* Ad relevance
* Landing page experience

To improve your ad quality, focus on the three components of Quality Score
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ``Expected clickthrough rate:`` The likelihood that the add will be clicked

  * Expected clickthrough rate (eCTR) predicts whether your keyword is likely to lead to an ad click.
  * ``Be specific in your ad:`` Include keywords in your ad text (especially in the headline) to show people that your ad is directly relevant to their search.
  * ``Experiment with different calls to action:`` Do you offer free shipping or free returns? Call now vs. book now?
  * ``Highlight a unique benefit of your product or service:`` What makes you stand out from the competition? Think about what matters to users (perhaps an exceptional warranty or return policy).
  * ``Create time- or location-specific ad text:`` Test seasonal creative around holidays or special events, or test location-optimized creative.

* ``Ad relevance:`` How closely the ad matches the intent behind a user's search

  * ``Add negative keywords:`` Prevent your ads from showing on unwanted queries or queries not closely related to your product or service.
  * ``Be specific on mobile:`` If a user’s mobile search experience is different from desktop, test mobile-specific creatives.
  * ``Be local:`` Target the right region for your business by using only the relevant languages and locations.
  * ``Include relevant search terms in your ad copy:`` Adding search terms that are related to your business in your ad copy can help make your ad more resonant for users.

* ``Landing page experience:`` How relevant, transparent, add easy to navigate the page is for users

  * ``Send traffic to the right landing page:`` Direct clicks to pages related to a user’s query. If a search is for “striped shirts,” the landing page should feature striped shirts, not some other variety of shirts or clothing in general.
  * ``Be consistent:`` Make sure the landing page continues the conversation set up by your ad and follows through on the ad’s offer or call-to-action.
  * ``Make your site transparent and trustworthy:`` Make it easy for visitors to find your contact information, and clearly state what your business does. If you request personal information from customers, make it clear why you’re asking for it and what you’ll do with it.
  * ``Work on loading speed and clarity:`` Help users quickly find what they’re looking for by prioritizing the content that’s visible above-the-fold.
  * ``Rethink mobile:`` Ease of navigation is valued by users even more on mobile websites, so make sure yours is optimized.

Deliver the right message with text ads
#######################################

3 required parts of a text ad
=============================

* Headline
* Description
* URL

How many ads should be implemented per ad group
===============================================

* 3-5 ads

1. What's a text ad?
====================

To effectively reach potential customers, text ads should be informative, relevant, and engaging.

Headline
--------

* Tip: 

  * Include at least one of your keywords in your headline: Keywords in your ad text show your ad’s relevance to what people want. For example, if you've included "mountain bikes" and "new bikes" as keywords, one of your ad headlines could be "Buy New Mountain Bikes."

* Details:

  * Up to three headline fields are available with up to 30 characters each. The first two headline fields are required, and the third is optional.
  * Look out for how your longer headlines — separated by a vertical pipe ("|") — might wrap on mobile devices.
  
Description - Tip
-----------------
  
On mobile, where space is tight, Google Ads optimizes your ad to show the highest-performing text. ( 90 char )

* ``Highlight what makes your business unique:`` Free shipping? Dazzling variety? Tell people! Showcase the products, services, or offers that make you competitive.
* ``Include prices, promotions, and exclusive offers:`` People often use Google Search to find information and get things done. Give them what they need to make a decision. If you have a limited-time discount or stock an exclusive product, say so.
* ``Empower customers to take action:`` Are you selling something or offering a service? Calls to action — like purchase, call today, order, browse, sign up, or get a quote — make next steps clear to your potential customer.

URL - Tip
---------

Match your ad to your landing page: Have a look at the page that you're linking to from your ad (the landing page), and make sure that the promotions or products in your ad are included there. People might leave your website if they don’t find what they expect.


2. How to create effective text ads
===================================

Steps to create a text ad in Google Ads

* ``Optimize your ad rotation for clicks or conversions:`` Optimizing your ad rotation will allow the system to serve the ideal ad for the specific circumstances of each auction
* ``Use at least three extensions for each campaign or ad group:`` At the time of each auction, your ad will be assembled with the most appealing extensions. More eligible extensions give your ads more opportunity to meet user's specific needs.

Tip
---

When you rotate your ads to optimize for clicks or conversions, ad groups with three or more high-quality ads may receive up to 15% more clicks or conversions, compared to ad groups with one or two ads.

Make ads relevant with Search Ad Extensions
===========================================

1. Explain why ad extensions matter
===================================

* Every single query on Google reflects a specific consumer need.
* Using the right ad extensions improves user experiences and increases engagement

What do users want?
-------------------

* Relevant information
* Information based on their moment
* Ads that contribute to their experience

Why does this matter to users?
-------------------------------

* Increased engagement
* ``Better ad quality:`` Ad formats will impact Ad Rank
* ``More qualified leads:`` Giving users relevant information up front often translates into more qualified leads. Because users know what to expect when they arrive on your website, they're more likely to fulfill the action fostered by the ad.


2. Choose the right ad extensions
=================================

Google Ads automatically serves the ad extensions that are predicted to have a positive impact on performance.

How are ad extensions served?
-----------------------------

* At any given time, up to four extensions can show for a particular query or device.
* Google Ads shows one or more extensions with your client’s ad when it calculates that the extension (or combination of extensions) will improve campaign performance, and when the Ad Rank is high enough for it to appear.

Universal extensions
--------------------

three extensions every marketer should be using to enhance their text ad

* sitelinks
* callout extensions
* structured snippets

Sitelinks: Direct to specific sections of the website
-----------------------------------------------------

* Benefit of sitelinks

  * ``Increased engagement:`` Adding sitelinks can boost the average clickthrough rate (CTR) for an ad, including in searches for one of the advertiser's brand terms.
  * ``More conversions:`` By sending users directly to the right page, you reduce the number of steps they need to perform for an action that you value.
  * ``Easy to manage:`` Add and update sitelinks at the account, campaign, or ad group level without the need to bid separately or add separate keywords. The system automatically displays the best performing or most relevant sitelinks for each query.

* Why should you use sitelinks?

  * directing to specfic pages
  * IMPORTANT: sitelink can't be the same as the headline links
  * Purposes: ( Driving store sales, Making online conversions, Raising brand awareness )
  
Sitelinks - Tip, Best Practices
-------------------------------

``Add as many sitelinks as you can:`` You should ideally implement 8 to 10 active sitelinks per campaign. Make sure you have enough content on your website to have at least two sitelinks, otherwise the sitelinks won't show.
``Select the right landing pages:`` Link directly to popular or high-converting sections of your website.
``Guide the user:`` In the sitelink title, clearly mention what users will find on the landing page.

Callout extensions: Highlight value-adding attributes
-----------------------------------------------------

Callout extensions are short, specific (25-character) snippets of text. They can be used to highlight information about value-adding attributes of the business, products, or services

Callout extensions: Benefits of callouts
----------------------------------------

* ``Boosts engagement:`` In our tests, this added information drove a ~10% increase in CTR. Callout extensions are a powerful way to highlight value-added attributes about a particular product or service.
* ``Easy to implement:`` Just add 25 characters for most languages, or 12 characters for double-width languages (like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean).

Callout extnsions: Why use?
---------------------------

Callout extensions are short snippets of text and can serve multiple marketing objectives such as:

* ``Drive store sales:`` Free pickup in store; no lines at checkout
* ``Online conversions:`` 365-day returns; free shipping over $25; 24/7 customer service
* ``Brand awareness:`` Zero-waste policy; organic material only

Callout extensions: Tips and best practices
-------------------------------------------

* ``Be brief:`` Keep your callouts as short and specific as possible, and include at least six of them in your campaigns.
* ``Be appealing:`` Consider callouts that are unique offerings and can apply at a high level to your whole business.
* ``Be concrete:`` Focus on specific info (for example, “4.7-inch LED display” vs. “large LED display” and “34 MPG max mileage” vs. “great fuel economy”).
* ``Think bullet points:`` "Free shipping" is much sharper than "We have free shipping." Sentence case beats title case (e.g., “100% silk” vs. “100% Silk”).

Structured snippets: Give a glimpse of what’s offered
-----------------------------------------------------

Structured snippets allow you to describe features of a specific product or range of products or services offered by the business before users click on the ad.

Location extensions
-------------------

Location extensions let you show your business address, phone number, and a map marker alongside your ad text. On mobile devices, there’s a link with directions to your business


Location extensions - Benefit
-----------------------------

* ``Drive store sales:`` By helping users find a nearby store, you improve the chance that they’ll visit you and make purchases in person.
* ``Drive online sales:`` Many users feel more confident buying online if they know there is a store close to them (in case they’d like to exchange or return what they’ve bought).
* ``Increase performance:`` On average, ads with location extensions see a 10% boost in CTR.
* ``Boost visibility:`` Add a bid modifier for users who are close to a store location. This increases the ad's visibility and the chances that the user will visit the store.
* ``Report store visits:`` Location extensions are one of the requirements if advertisers want to report store visits.


Location extensions - When to use
---------------------------------

Location extensions are great if you have physical stores that you can drive foot traffic to, or for otherwise encouraging customer visits.

Location extensions - Tips and best practices
---------------------------------------------

* ``Keep information updated:`` Location extensions are served via the Google My Business (GMB) account. Make sure information such as address and phone number are updated.
* ``Adapt bids:`` Bid more aggressively for users who are close to your stores to ensure they see your ad. This can be done via the Advanced Location settings in Google Ads.

Affiliate location extensions
-----------------------------

Give directions to retail partner locations (available in select countries): Affiliate location extensions allow product manufacturers to drive visits to retail partners that sell their products. The format displays the headline and URL for the manufacturer’s website, ad text for the manufacturer’s product, and the nearest retailer.

Affiliate location extensions - Benefits
----------------------------------------

* ``Drive store sales:`` By helping consumers find a nearby retailer that sells your product, you improve the chance that they’ll visit you and make a purchase in person.
* ``Drive online sales:`` Consumers have the option to visit the manufacturer's website and purchase online if they don’t have time to visit the retailer.
* ``Report store visits:`` Affiliate location extensions are one of the requirements if manufacturers want to report store visits.

Affiliate location extensions - When to use
----------------------------------------

Affiliate location extensions are ideal for manufacturers. They help consumers find their products at select retailers, while still providing the option to visit their website and purchase online.

Affiliate location extensions - Tips and best practices
-------------------------------------------------------

* ``Maximize local reach:`` In the Google Ads interface, select retail chains or automotive dealerships to highlight all of the nearby locations where consumers can find your products.

* ``Flexible scheduling:`` Specify what dates, days of the week, or times of day call extensions should appear, aligned with your business's (or call center's) opening hours. Outside the designated times, the ad won't show the call button (mobile) or phone number (desktop) when it is displayed.

Call extensions - When to use
-----------------------------

Use call extensions if you do business over the phone and value phone calls as much as you value clicks to your website

Call extensions - Tips and best practices
-----------------------------

* ``Measure the impact:`` Enable phone call conversions reporting in account settings to assess which campaigns, ad groups, and keywords are most effective at driving call conversions.
* ``Provide great service:`` Once customers call you, success mainly depends on the service they receive from your call center. Make sure your staff is trained to answer questions about the services or products that your extensions are associated with.

Other extensions

How Audience solutions can enhance your Search strategy
-------------------------------------------------------

3 ways that Google’s Audience solutions can help you enhance your Search strategy

* Variable bidding
* Keyword expansion
* Create customization

How Audience solutions can enhance your Search strategy - Variable bidding
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* What

Layer at least one audience group on top of your Search campaign, and bid differently for that audience based on their value to your business.

* How:

Increase your bids on certain audiences:

If you bid higher for certain audiences, you’ll potentially have your ad shown at a better position when people search for you. For example, using Affinity Audiences, Hiroko could bid higher for customers searching for “mountain bikes” who are also passionate about outdoor adventure sports.

Decrease your bids on certain audiences:

Certain audiences might not have as strong a performance as others do, so you can reduce your bids when those audiences search for you. For example, using Remarketing Lists for Search Ads, you may know that certain past visitors have a low shopping basket average value. Bidding lower for lists that include such visitors may improve your overall campaign performance.

* Why you should care

Ad auctions are competitive, and you want to make sure you’re making the right bids when certain groups of people are searching for you.

How Audience solutions can enhance your Search strategy - Keyword expansion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* What

Expand your keyword set to larger set terms and more broad terms. Engage the mid- and upper funnel for greater reach.

* How

Create ad groups that target generic keywords and only show ads to certain audiences. Bidding for generic keywords can be costly, as it’s not always a given that people searching for those terms are in the market for your product.

* Why you should care

For example, people searching for the term “commute options” might not be looking for bicycles and aren’t relevant customers for a bike shop. You may decide to create an ad group that targets generic terms like “commute” and only have your ads shown to people that have been added to an in-market list for "Autos & Vehicles > Vehicles (Other) > Bicycles & Accessories," increasing the relevancy of your ad.

How Audience solutions can enhance your Search strategy - Create customization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* What

Reach different audience segments with unique messaging that will resonate best with them. Using Google Audiences, you can tailor your ad creatives based on the user.

* How

You can build ad groups catering to specific audience lists and create bespoke text ads for those groups of people.

For example, using Customer Match, you can create an ad that will show only to people who have signed up to your mailing list, offering them a discount for returning to your site.

* Why you should care

The more relevant your ads, the better the user experience for your customers, leading to a higher click-through rate and better campaign performance! 

For example, using Remarketing Lists for Search Ads, you can create an ad that’s relevant for new customers and only show it to them (by excluding all the people who’ve already visited your site in the past year).

2. Reach prospective customers with Google's Search Audience solutions

-------

* Affinity Audiences

Affinity Audiences aggregates users who’ve demonstrated a qualified interest in a given topic, allowing you to access the people your product or service will most likely matter to.

Detailed Demographics
---------------------

Using Detailed Demographics, you can reach customers based on their activities on Google.com. These activities may indicate certain things about their lives, including parental status, parenting stage, homeownership status, marital status, and education status.

In-Market Audiences
-------------------

Google’s Audience solutions can tell the difference between interest and intent.

NOTE
----

Affinity Audiences, Detailed Demographics, and In-Market Audiences are auto-included and automatically used as a ``signal for conversion-based search bidding strategies``.

3. Harness the power of your own data to reach your marketing objectives
========================================================================

Remarketing Lists for Search Ads (RLSA)
---------------------------------------

Remarketing Lists for Search Ads allows you to serve unique ad creatives and set your ad group bids differently, based on past interactions with your site or app.

Improving campaign performance with RLSA
----------------------------------------

sample groups

* group1: never heard of site

  * Create a text ad that includes a "new user offer" to reach the first group, as these people haven't been to her site yet

* group2: visited site before, but still researching different options

  * Bid higher for the second group, which has a greater chance of converting, since these people already know about her site.

* group3: reached site's checkout page, but didn't fill in their detail

  * Create a a text ad that includes a special "return offer" to reach the third group. These people might decide to return and make a purchase!
  
So how does this all work exactly?
----------------------------------
  
  Once Site are taged with the Google Ads remarketing tag, people who visit will be added to Site remarketing lists. Site can then define different audience lists based on the pages these people visited and the recency of their interaction with her site.

What's possible after that?

* Increase bids on certain audiences  
* Decrease bids on certain audiences 
* Create ad groups targeting generic keywords and only show ads to those who’ve visited her before
* Tailor ad creatives based on the customer
* Exclude certain audience lists from campaigns

Policies and requirements
-------------------------

Google only uses data to serve ads as specified by your campaign setup. We don’t share the cookie lists with any advertisers, including you as the account owner. A remarketing list must have at least 1,000 users on it before it can be used.

Customer Match
--------------

Your customer relationship management (CRM) data can help you understand the types of people who have a relationship with your brand, and you can use insights from your data to address your marketing challenges. 

Customer Match allows you to leverage your online and offline customer data to reach your customers and deliver the right message wherever they are, on any device, across Search, YouTube, and Discovery.

Customer Match - How it works
-----------------------------

Upload your customer data into Google Ads. We’ll match it against the people who search on Google.com, and form it into audience lists. The upload can include various types of customer data (for matching), such as email address, mailing address, and phone number. Let's take a closer look at the steps below.

* ``Segment:`` Segment a customer list based on desired marketing action (e.g., reactivation of lapsed customers).
* ``Upload:`` Upload the list to Google Ads.
* ``Audience Lists:`` The list is translated into an audience list and made available for targeting on Search, YouTube, and Discovery.
* ``Customize Creative:`` Customize your creatives with special offers or incentives that are specific to this audience.

Customer Match - Why complement your Audience strategy with Customer Match?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Diversify your audience strategy with a tagless strategy.
* Re-engage with customers you haven’t seen in awhile.
* Reach customers who may not have converted online and aren’t a part of your remarketing lists (i.e, customers who converted off your app or in your store).
* Reach customers based on their purchase history (i.e, customers who’ve made at least one purchase in the last month). 
* Reach customers according to their lifetime value.

Similar Audiences 
-----------------

Similar Audiences leverages your remarketing lists to find new customers with similar characteristics as your existing customers. It can help you expand the reach of your valuable audiences, across all platforms.

Similar Audiences - How it works
--------------------------------

1. Similar Audiences finds people that are similar to those on an original remarketing “seed” list. The people are similar in profile based on the seed list members’ recent browsing interests, search terms, and videos watched on YouTube.
2. Our system “scores” people based on how similar they are to those on the original seed list, with similarity defined as interested in the same categories, topics, and products.
3. Once you have lists of similar audiences, you can layer these lists over your campaigns and bid higher to reach valuable potential customers.

* NOT: Each similar audience has its seed list members removed to ensure that no one overlaps between a similar list and its seed list. In the case of an All Visitors list, this would mean that the Similar to All Visitors list is comprised of users who’ve not been to your site before.

Boost Performance with Optimization Score
#########################################

1. What are the benefits of optimization score?
-----------------------------------------------

Optimizing Search campaigns can be a challenging task. That’s because there are many ways to improve the performance and ROI of each campaign. To streamline the process, Google Ads is introducing optimization score.

Why optimization score?
----------------------

The higher your score, the more your account is running to its full potential. 

What are the benefits of Optimization Score?
--------------------------------------------

* ``Instant:`` With optimization score, you get real-time estimates of how your accounts and campaigns are performing
* ``Customized:`` Optimization score uses a variety of methods, such as statistical modeling, to give you recommendations tailored to your account’s performance.
* ``Scalable:`` Scores and recommendations are available for campaigns, accounts, and most manager accounts (MCCs). This allows you to apply recommendations across multiple layers of your advertising strategy.

2. How does optimization score work?
------------------------------------

Put optimization score to work for you
---------------------------------------

* How is your optimization score calculated?

Optimization score runs an algorithm that looks across key aspects of your accounts, including statistics, settings, and industry trends, to determine whether your campaigns are fully optimized. When optimization potential is detected, the system provides recommendations to close the gap. For example, an account with a score of 80% could improve its performance by 20% if the listed recommendations are adopted.

* Where do the points come from?

A combination of statistical models, simulations, and machine learning is used to assign points to each recommendation, based on the likelihood that it will enhance your account’s performance. If a recommendation can have more impact, it’s weighted more heavily toward your overall score.

* What does this mean for your business?

Optimization score is made up of over 50 recommendations, meant to help you make your advertising more efficient, reach new audiences, and spend smarter. The score is real-time responsive, so it’s a snapshot of your optimization potential at a given time. That means you can instantly improve your account by applying recommendations that meet your business objectives.
